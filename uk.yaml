    country goal to collectively mobilise $100bn per year in climate finance from
    a variety of sources by 2020, efforts have been undertaken internationally to
    enhance climate finance transparency. This discussion will present examples of
    good practice from recent efforts to assess individual and collective progress
    in scaling up climate finance and improving transparency, including the recently
    released OECD analysis of public climate finance from 2013-2017.<br>  The event
    will ask what further developments are needed to align incentives in climate finance
    reporting for building trust and facilitating effective and transparent climate
