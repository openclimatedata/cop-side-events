  description: <p><p>China and the EU have increasingly become the centre of attention
    when it comes to leadership in terms of increasing climate ambition. <br/></p><p>However,
    in order to deliver on this position they will have to demonstrate significant
    efforts to raise the level of ambition. <br/></p><p>This side events presents
    recent research combining grounded technical analysis with strategic outreach
    to communicate how both China and the EU can lead the way. <br/></p><p>The event
    will present aligned, regionally-driven modelling efforts for China and the EU
    that identify concrete actions at the sectoral level that can lead to a peaking
    of overall CO2 emissions in China by 2020, and net-zero emissions in Europe by
    2050, for instance. <br/></p><p>Additionally, a panel will discuss strategic outreach
    to ensure the potential for these enhanced actions will be understood and shared
    by other countries, regions and actors.</p></p>

  description: <p><p>A cost-effective full decarbonisation of our economy by mid-century
    is not an option anymore. <span class="Bodytext20"><span>With the European power
    sector committing to be fully carbon-neutral well before 2050</span></span>, new</p><p>opportunities
    are opening to Europe.</p><p>In this landscape, electrification of our energy
    usages, notably of mobility, will have a growing role to play. At the crossroad
    of penetration of renewables, storage, and decentralised energy, electrified mobility
    progressively appears as a one-off opportunity to be seized by Europe for global
    competitiveness while supporting European automotive and electricity industries.</p><p>For
    this future to happen, battery is a key technology, building bridge between mobility
    and power systems. For instance,flexibility services that Vehicle to Grid technologies
    provide for balancing of the electricity grid could become an <span>important
    </span>element of the integrated energy system.</p><p>This session intends to
    highlight the challenges and opportunities created by the electrification of mobility
    and will shed light on key public and private initiatives, such as the EBA, that

    emissions from international aviation and shipping under ICAO and IMO, and ask
    whether the current approaches are aligned with achieving the temperature goals
    of the Paris Agreement. The aviation sector is at an advanced stage of designing
    its approach to limit emissions growth, largely via offsetting. The speakers will
    present new analysis on the potential supply and cost of offset credits,providing
    insights into the likely mitigation impact of CORSIA demand under different eligibility
    restrictions as well as regional measures to fill in the global ambition gap in
    decarbonising international aviation. The shipping sector is playing catch up
    and considering a much wider set of measures. The speakers will present a case
    study on decarbonising short-sea shipping, which can be driven by regional climate
    and industrial policy, and the role it can play in accelerating the innovation
    for the global fleet. We will discuss the findings and the need for bottom up
    as well as top down regulation with a panel formed of policy makers and industry

  description: <p><p>Non-state and sub-national actors, such as local governments,
    businesses and civil society networks, are making commitments in great numbers
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to already-occurring impact of
    climate change. This side event addresses two urgent questions. First, how do
    non-state and sub-national climate actions perform? Second, how can such actions
    be strengthened in order to implement the Paris Agreement and achieve higher ambition?</p><p>This
    event will see the launch of the first annual report of Climate Chance's Observatory
    for non-state climate action which documents non-state and sub-national actions
    through a series of briefs analysing the recent evolution of sector-based emissions,
    and a review of the main local governments' networks including case studies of
    territories committed to mitigation goals. Moreover, the event will discuss insights
    of the 2018 and 2017 UNFCCC Yearbook of Global Climate Action on the actual performance
    of non-state and sub-national actions since 2013. Special attention will be given
    to the role of climate action in the global South.</p><p>Challenges to boost climate
    action remain. For instance, climate actions are unevenly distributed; currently
    recorded actions still do not fill the ambition gaps left by current policies;
    and important stakeholder groups, for instance rural communities, small and medium
    enterprises - especially in developing countries - remain underrepresented. The
    event will therefore discuss how multi-stakeholder dialogue and policy instruments
    and tool-kits, for instance through the International Climate Governance Coalition
    (ICGC), could meet needs and challenges to climate action and seize opportunities
    to enable non-state and sub-national climate actions worldwide.</p></p>

    best efforts to achieve a transition to a sustainable and zero-carbon economy,
    thus contributing together with all the stakeholders directly to the implementation
    of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This transition requires major public
    and private funding efforts. </p><p>As has been advocated by many economists and
    key political figures from civil society, we need to encourage and support all
    projects that can unite Europe's strengths in the interests of workers, businesses
    and all Europeans. This is the objective of a finance-climate pact for high-quality
    jobs. The finance-climate pact aims to redirect the money that could bring about
    a new financial bubble towards the fight against climate change and the real economy.
    It must also receive new financing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
    The pact must provide a new roadmap for European leadership and should be accompanied
    by an integrated plan. Moreover, small to medium scale financing, can be difficult
    to access for bottom-up projects. The key is not only to provide finance, but
    also for existing financing mechanisms to be unambiguous and easy to access.</p><p><span
    lang="EN-US">The purpose of this event will be to propose ways to guarantee the
    appropriate funding needed to achieve the transition to a zero-carbon economy
    and a sustainable Europe by 2050. Financing must be designed to foster a just
    transition and address adaptation policies. During the event, a new set of proposals
    formulated by the EESC will be discussed with different organisations with the
    aim to boost climate finance and facilitate access to it for transformative projects.</span><br/></p></p>

    of European carbon allowances has increased significantly. Recent research indicate

    \ of a megalopolis: difficult to manage and control.<br/></span></div><div><span>Indeed,\
    \ in many capitals around the world, the management of urban space poses a problem.\
    \ Conakry faces many challenges, such as a lack of modern roads, maintenance,\
    \ permanent cleaning channels and gutters, dilapidated\_facilities, and in places,\
    \ no sanitation. Mains drainage is a recent concept, and its use is not yet widespread.\
    \ When we add the non-education of users in the management of public utility to\
    \ this equation, we begin to understand the difficulties that are increasing by\
    \ the day. Conakry is no exception to this rule.</span></div><p></p></p>"

  description: "<p><p>European transport today is almost exclusively fuelled by imported\
    \ oil, accounts for a quarter of the Union\u2019s total emissions, and is the\
    \ only sector whose emissions are still on the rise. <br/></p><p>The shift away\
    \ from fossil fuel-driven private modes of mobility towards shared mobility based\
    \ on human power and renewable energy sources therefore holds significant promise\
    \ for the future. <br/></p><p>The \u2018smart charging\u2019 of electric vehicles\
    \ will be key to enabling them to work in harmony with the grid while accelerating\
    \ the uptake of self-consumption in residential buildings and lowering costs for\
    \ consumers. <br/></p><p>In a decentralised and smart energy system, together\
    \ with renewable energy sources, new technologies such as electro-mobility and\
    \ its charging infrastructure are gaining importance. <br/></p><p>An ambitious\
    \ and forward-looking EU policy framework will be key to ensuring a coherent approach\
    \ and level playing field for all actors from national and local policy makers,\
