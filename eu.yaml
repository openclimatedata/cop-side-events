    emissions from international aviation and shipping under ICAO and IMO, and ask
    whether the current approaches are aligned with achieving the temperature goals
    of the Paris Agreement. The aviation sector is at an advanced stage of designing
    its approach to limit emissions growth, largely via offsetting. The speakers will
    present new analysis on the potential supply and cost of offset credits,providing
    insights into the likely mitigation impact of CORSIA demand under different eligibility
    restrictions as well as regional measures to fill in the global ambition gap in
    decarbonising international aviation. The shipping sector is playing catch up
    and considering a much wider set of measures. The speakers will present a case
    study on decarbonising short-sea shipping, which can be driven by regional climate
    and industrial policy, and the role it can play in accelerating the innovation
    for the global fleet. We will discuss the findings and the need for bottom up

  description: <p><p>Non-state and sub-national actors, such as local governments,
    businesses and civil society networks, are making commitments in great numbers
    to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt to already-occurring impact of
    climate change. This side event addresses two urgent questions. First, how do
    non-state and sub-national climate actions perform? Second, how can such actions
    be strengthened in order to implement the Paris Agreement and achieve higher ambition?</p><p>This
    event will see the launch of the first annual report of Climate Chance's Observatory
    for non-state climate action which documents non-state and sub-national actions
    through a series of briefs analysing the recent evolution of sector-based emissions,
    and a review of the main local governments' networks including case studies of
    territories committed to mitigation goals. Moreover, the event will discuss insights
    of the 2018 and 2017 UNFCCC Yearbook of Global Climate Action on the actual performance
    of non-state and sub-national actions since 2013. Special attention will be given
    to the role of climate action in the global South.</p><p>Challenges to boost climate
    action remain. For instance, climate actions are unevenly distributed; currently
    recorded actions still do not fill the ambition gaps left by current policies;
    and important stakeholder groups, for instance rural communities, small and medium
    enterprises - especially in developing countries - remain underrepresented. The
    event will therefore discuss how multi-stakeholder dialogue and policy instruments
    and tool-kits, for instance through the International Climate Governance Coalition
    (ICGC), could meet needs and challenges to climate action and seize opportunities
    to enable non-state and sub-national climate actions worldwide.</p></p>

    a new financial bubble towards the fight against climate change and the real economy.
    It must also receive new financing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.
    The pact must provide a new roadmap for European leadership and should be accompanied
    by an integrated plan. Moreover, small to medium scale financing, can be difficult

    of European carbon allowances has increased significantly. Recent research indicate
    however that the rates are too low to achieve the Paris Agreement goals and that
    the pricing gap is declining too slowly - at the current pace, the gap between
    carbon prices and real climate costs may not close before 2095.</span></p><p><span><span>This

    mechanisms will contribute to the Paris goals and to the different pathways and

  description: "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sub-Saharan Africa is a region particularly\
    \ vulnerable to climate change, with the agriculture sector especially affected.\
    \ High numbers of people suffer from inadequate nutrition (hidden hunger) and\
    \ chronic food insecurity. As a result of climate change, this group of affected\
    \ people \u2013 mostly smallholder farmers \u2013 will further increase due to\
    \ extreme and unpredictable climate impacts. Thus, risk-informed investment into\
    \ adaptation is needed, to enable farmers to sustainably transform their livelihoods.\
    \ Taking weather risk insurance as an example, the linkages between climate risk\
    \ and evidence-based adaptation policy-making are highlighted, which is especially\
    \ timely in the context of NDC implementation. Risk reduction and weather risk\
    \ insurance as a residual risk-transfer strategy shows great potential for coping\
    \ with climate impacts and is widely promoted among researchers and policy-makers\
    \ alike. However, better coupling with climate risk assessments can improve targeting,\
    \ cost-effectiveness and enable wider uptake. </span></p>"

  description: <p><p><i><span></span></i><span>The side event aims to explore how
    urban sustainability frameworks reinforce the potential and relevance of cultural
    heritage to drive urban development and climate change mitigation and adaptation.
    How do the urban sustainability frameworks launched by the World Bank and the
    Global Environment Facility and now standardised by the International Standards
    Organization incorporate cultural heritage? Using the commonality established
    by frameworks, how can cities work together to boost sustainable and inclusive
    business innovation and entrepreneurship in cultural heritage to raise ambitions
    in tackling climate change? The Horizon 2020 ROCK project will be presented as
    an EU flagship initiative in this realm, and a demonstrator of the contribution
    of cultural heritage to sustainable development in the urban environment via an
    integrated framework approach.</span></p><p><span></span><i><span></span></i><br/></p></p>
